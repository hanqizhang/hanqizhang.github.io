I'm always open to collaborations. If you found anything interesting and would like to collaborate to extend some of the ideas, please don't wait to reach me at hqzhang [at] nyu [dot] edu.

Also, if you found any mistakes or inconsistencies that are mathematical, logical, factual, etc., I'd really appreciate your correction.

**Setting up RSS feeds**

RSS and Atom are standard formats for distributing online content in a structured way. For example, if you have several blogs that you want to follow, you can subscribe to them at an Atom/RSS reader website (such as [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) and [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/)) which will allow you to check these blogs from something like an email reader.

To subscribe to this blog, simply copy the link from the top-right icon on this page to your Atom/RSS reader.

<!--Since this blog often contains LaTeX math equations, I recommend using an Atom/RSS reader that supports javascript bookmarklets, such as the one linked above. Then install [render MathJax](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~robjohn/math/mathjax.html) with one simple drag. Every time you come across a page with LaTeX content rendered by MathJax, click on the bookmarklet and the equations should dislay correctly. -->
